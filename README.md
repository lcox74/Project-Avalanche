# Project-Avalanch
Avalanch is a 3D game engine made in C++ and uses openGL for rendering. The visuals are heavily shader based as the shader programs run on the GPU and is alot faster at doing calculations than the CPU. I created a simple material file system `.mt` which can be parsed through the engine to create PBR materials.

## Features
- Avalanch can import 3D models from blender, preferably in .obj formatt as .blend files get a but buggy.
- Lighting
- Materials and Texturing
- Third Person Camera
- Pitiful car controls
